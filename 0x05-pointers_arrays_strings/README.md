# C - Pointers, arrays and strings
In this project, I learned about what and how to use pointers and arrays and the differences between the two as well

2-strlen.c: C function that returns the length of a string.

3-puts.c: C function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.

4-print_rev.c: C function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.

5-rev_string.c: C function that reverses a string.

6-puts2.c: C function that prints every other character of a string, followed by a new line.

7-puts_half.c: C function that prints the second half of a string, followed by a new line.

8-print_array.c: C function that prints an input n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.

9. strcpy

9-strcpy.c: C function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.

10. Great leaders are willing to sacrifice the numbers to save the people. Poor leaders sacrifice the people to save the numbers
